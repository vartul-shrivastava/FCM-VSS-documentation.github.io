FCM-VSS Features
================

FCM-VSS offers a rich set of features to help you manage, visualize, and simulate Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). Here's an overview of the main functionalities:

1. **AES-GCM Encryption**
   -----------------------
   FCM-VSS ensures secure data handling by using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Galois Counter Mode (GCM). This encryption is used to secure FCM projects, checkpoints, and snapshots, preventing unauthorized access.

   - The session key is used to encrypt and decrypt files during an active session.
   - Files encrypted in one session can only be accessed with the same session key in another session.

   **How to Use:**
   - At the start of each session, the user is prompted to enter a session key for AES-GCM encryption.
   - This key must be used throughout the session for saving and loading projects.

2. **Checkpoint and Snapshot Management**
   --------------------------------------
   FCM-VSS allows users to save their FCM network configuration at any point using checkpoints. These checkpoints can be used to restore previous states, facilitating an organized workflow.

   - **Checkpoints**: Save the state of the FCM at any point during the process. A tray for capturing and selecting checkpoints is maintained.
   - **Snapshots**: Export and import FCM configurations as snapshots.

   **How to Use:**
   - Save checkpoints during the development process using the **Save as Checkpoint** option.
   - Snapshots can be exported for future reference, ensuring the network configuration is preserved.

3. **Node and Edge Manipulation**
   ------------------------------
   FCM-VSS offers intuitive controls for creating and managing FCM networks. You can add, delete, rename, or adjust nodes and edges in real time.

   **Key Features**:
   - Add or remove nodes and edges with a simple click.
   - Keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow:
     - **Ctrl + Q**: Add Node
     - **Ctrl + E**: Add Edge
   - Visual feedback for selected nodes and edges.

4. **AI-powered Summarization**
   ----------------------------
   FCM-VSS integrates locally hosted AI models through **Ollama** to generate summaries of the FCM configuration.

   **How it works**:
   - Summarization is based on node statistics, Kosko simulation values, and the difference in static node convergence values.
   - The summary is generated and presented as a tri-partite structure: node statistics, Kosko convergence values, and static node comparison.

   **How to Use**:
   - Select the AI model from the dropdown in the playground.
   - Click the **AI-Summarize FCM Config** button to get the AI-based summary.

5. **Real-Time Simulations with Kosko Algorithms**
   -----------------------------------------------
   FCM-VSS supports multiple Kosko-based inference mechanisms:
   - **Original Kosko**
   - **Modified Kosko** (with self-influence)
   - **Rescaled Kosko** (re-scaled with normalization)

   **How to Use**:
   - Access simulation settings from the bottom menu.
   - Choose from different inference mechanisms, transfer functions, and activation patterns.

   See the [Kosko Simulation](kosko_simulation.rst) page for more details on how to configure and run these simulations.
